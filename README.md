# DataStructures
Each project focuses on the use of a particular data structure.

Project 1: Course Planner - Arrays
Uses and array of Course objects to create a Planner for a student.

Project 2: Train - Linked Lists
Creates a Doubly Linked List of TrainCarNodes with various loads. 
Methods allow you to filter for certain TrainCars and remove Dangerous Loads.

Project 3: TimeComplexityCalculator - Stacks
Takes in Python file from Scanner and returns the time complexity of the given file.
Checks for nested and non-nested iterative blocks to determine the time complexity correctly.

Project 4: Network Simulation - Queues
Simulates the flow of Packets to intermediate routers, and how they are able to end at a particular destination router.
Constraints in simulation: Bandwidth, Size of the Packet, Arrival Probability, Number of Intermediate Routers, and Max Buffer Size.
